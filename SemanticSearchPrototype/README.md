This route.ts file implements a serverless API endpoint for performing semantic search using embeddings generated by the Supabase/gte-small model via Xenova Transformers, and a Supabase rpc function for vector similarity matching.

SUPABASE RPC FUNCTION:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION semantic_query_match(
  query_embedding vector(384),
  match_threshold float,
  match_count int
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid,
  content text,
  similarity float
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
#variable_conflict use_column
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT
    id,
    content,
    1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) as similarity
  FROM
    documents
  WHERE
    1 - (embedding <=> query_embedding) > match_threshold
  ORDER BY
    similarity DESC
  LIMIT
    match_count;
END;
$$;
```

- I currently have manually-added embeddings as entries in a supabase table. 
- This api route generates embeddings for input queries using the Supabase/gte-small model.
- Performs semantic similarity search against a Supabase database using a custom semantic_query_match RPC function.
- Returns matching documents along with their similarity scores.

This is built on a blank nextjs app, so  getting the api route to work is simple.
